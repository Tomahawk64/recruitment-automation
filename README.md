### Setup Steps

1. **Clone/Navigate to the project**
   ```powershell
   cd "c:\Users\HP\Desktop\recruitment automation"
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```powershell
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update MongoDB URI, R2 credentials, EmailJS keys

4. **Seed demo data**
   ```powershell
   npm run seed
   ```

5. **Start the application**
   ```powershell
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start:
   - Backend API: http://localhost:4000
   - Frontend: http://localhost:3000

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: npm run dev (Recommended for Local Testing)

```powershell
# Install all dependencies
npm run install:all

# Seed demo data (creates 11 closures, 3 invoices)
npm run seed

# Start both backend and frontend
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

```powershell
# Start all services (MongoDB + Backend + Frontend)
npm run docker:up

# Seed data (after containers are running)
docker exec -it recruitment-backend npm run seed

# Stop services
npm run docker:down
```

## 📊 Demo Data

The seed script creates:
- **11 Closures** across 2 recruiters
- **Priya Sharma**: 6 closures (bonus eligible!)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### TypeScript Errors
The project will show TypeScript compile errors until dependencies are installed. Run:
```powershell
cd backend ; npm install
cd ../frontend ; npm install
```

### MongoDB Connection Issues
- Ensure MongoDB is running locally on port 27017
- Or update `MONGO_URI` in `.env` to use MongoDB Atlas

### R2 Upload Failures
- Invoice generation will work without R2 (PDF created but not uploaded)
- Mock URLs will be used for testing

### Email Not Sending
- EmailJS integration fails silently if not configured
- Check console logs for mock email output
